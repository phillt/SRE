## 💡 Problem

Modern LLM systems are great at reasoning, but **terrible at reading large documents efficiently**.
When you give an LLM a book, article, or research corpus, it can’t “study” it — it must re-ingest text every time you ask a question. This makes retrieval expensive, redundant, and error-prone.

One widely adopted fix is **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:

* You chunk the document, embed it, and store embeddings in a vector database.
* At query time, you compute a new embedding for your prompt, find the “closest” chunks, and send those to the model.

That works — but it’s **dynamic, probabilistic, and transient**:

* RAG treats every search as ephemeral. There’s no persistent, deterministic understanding of the source text.
* Retrieval depends on embedding models and similarity heuristics.
* Results can vary slightly between runs.
* And while some RAG systems can model hierarchical relationships, most focus on relevance, not structure or determinism.

## ⚙️ Our Solution: Static Research Engine (SRE)

SRE solves this by **compiling documents into static, structured knowledge artifacts** — just like a build system for language understanding.

When you “build” a corpus with SRE:

1. Text is normalized, hashed, and broken into deterministic spans (paragraphs).
2. Structural hints (headings, sections, chapters) are extracted and versioned.
3. A manifest, report, and node map are generated — making the corpus *self-describing*.
4. Search indexes and ranking stats are compiled once, producing permanent, queryable assets.

At runtime, LLMs or applications don’t need to re-parse or re-embed anything —
they simply **load** the compiled artifacts (`spans.jsonl`, `manifest.json`, `nodeMap.json`, `buildReport.json`) and **query them instantly** via the Reader API.

## 🧠 The Static Advantage

Traditional retrieval → *dynamic and probabilistic*.
SRE → *static and deterministic.*

| Problem         | Traditional (RAG)                                        | SRE Approach                             |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Data volatility | Each query reinterprets embeddings                       | Fixed, compiled spans and indexes        |
| Cost            | Requires re-embedding or vector DB access                | One-time compile, static files           |
| Explainability  | “Why did this chunk match?” depends on vector similarity | Full provenance (manifest + nodeMap)     |
| Determinism     | May vary by model or similarity threshold                | Bitwise reproducible builds              |
| Reuse           | One-off per query                                        | Artifacts are permanent and versionable  |
| Hosting         | Needs live vector DB                                     | Works from static JSON on any filesystem |

The result: **build once, query forever**.
SRE turns large, unstructured text into a *language model–ready corpus* — human-readable, hash-addressable, and analyzable offline.

## 🤝 How SRE Complements RAG

It’s important to note that **SRE does not replace RAG** — it **enhances it**.
Each serves a different role in the reasoning stack.

**RAG** provides *immediate, dynamic context*, while **SRE** provides *persistent, deterministic structure*.

When a user or agent issues a request:

1. **RAG** finds the most relevant snippets using embeddings — fast, dynamic recall.
2. **SRE** then expands that context by traversing the structured corpus — deterministic, explainable discovery.

This pairing means that RAG tells the agent **where to look**, and SRE gives it **everything it needs once it’s there.**

| Task              | RAG Does                                             | SRE Enables                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Context retrieval | Vector or token‑based retrieval of relevant snippets | Expansion into full context tree via nodeMap                             |
| Discovery         | Nearest‑neighbour recall / chunk‑graph traversal     | Deterministic navigation & search over structured corpus                 |
| Decision‑making   | Uses retrieved snippets to drive further reasoning   | Uses the full structure (chapters/sections) and provenance for reasoning |
| Storage           | Often a live vector DB or embedding store            | Static JSONL + deterministic indices viable offline                      |
| Determinism       | Results may vary by embedding model / vector service | Builds are reproducible, hash‑addressable                                |

Some RAG systems already support **hierarchical chunk‑graphs or semantic trees**, and SRE is designed to interoperate with those — not compete with them.
SRE’s value lies in turning that same structure into **first‑class, reproducible artifacts** that can be loaded, versioned, and reasoned over statically.

In practice, RAG acts as a **retrieval accelerator**, surfacing potential entry points in large corpora.
SRE acts as the **reasoning substrate**, giving the agent structured access to everything around those entry points — chapters, sections, headings, provenance, and metrics — all locally and reproducibly.

Together, they enable agents to move from *text matching* to *knowledge‑grounded reasoning*.

## 🎯 Who It’s For

✅ **Engineers and researchers** who:

* Need reproducible, explainable document retrieval for LLM pipelines.
* Want to pre-process datasets for offline LLM reasoning, QA, or summarization.
* Build RAG systems but want a static, local corpus foundation.
* Value provenance, structure, and deterministic builds over opaque embeddings.

✅ **Use cases**

* Knowledge bases and documentation compilers.
* Offline research assistants and LLM tools.
* Dataset preparation for fine-tuning or evaluation.
* Analytical indexing (law, science, policy, technical documentation).

## 🚫 Who It’s Not For

❌ Systems that require **semantic similarity or fuzzy reasoning** out of the box — SRE’s current version is purely lexical + ranked retrieval.
❌ Teams expecting **real-time ingestion or mutation** — SRE is static by design (build-time, not runtime).
❌ Casual users looking for a “plug and play chatbot.” This is a developer-oriented compiler/runtime, not a hosted service.
